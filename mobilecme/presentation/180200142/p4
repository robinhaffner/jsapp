While negative and cognitive symptoms do not respond to traditional pharmacologic treatment for schizophrenia, it is still important to establish that a patient's symptoms are not due to other causes that are potentially reversible. While more research is needed to better understand and treat negative and cognitive symptoms, they should nevertheless be monitored and targeted as much as possible in order to improve social and occupational functioning.</p><p>This activity is the first in a 4-module curriculum designed to improve clinicians' recognition of the degree to which persistent negative and cognitive symptoms impair functioning. Other modules focus on differentiating negative symptoms from other underlying psychiatric conditions (Module 2), assessing negative symptoms and cognitive function (Module 3), and current thinking around the neurobiology underlying these symptoms in schizophrenia and research that is exploring how to improve cognitive function and alleviate negative symptoms (Module 4).</p><h1>Learning Objectives</h1><p>As a result of participating in the activity, learners should be better able to:</p><ul> <li>Describe current hypotheses about the origins of negative and cognitive symptoms and treatments and interventions that may address them</li></ul><h1>Accreditation and Credit Designation</h1><p>This activity has been planned and implemented in accordance with the accreditation requirements and policies of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) through the joint providership of American Academy of CME, Inc., (Academy) and E&S MedEd Group, Inc. The American Academy of CME, Inc., is accredited by the ACCME to provide continuing medical education for physicians.</p><p>The American Academy of CME, Inc., designates this enduring material for a maximum of 0.25 </i>AMA PRA Category 1 Credits<sup>TM</sup>.</i> Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.</p><p>Independent Clinical Reviewer: No relevant financial relationships with any commercial interests.</p><p>Planners: John J.D. Juchniewicz, MCIS, CCMEP, American Academy of CME and Laurie Ermentrout, and Wendy Gloffke, PhD, E&S MedEd Group: No relevant financial relationships with any commercial interests.</p><p>There is no off-label or investigational information discussed in this module.</p><p>This activity is designed for use by health care professionals for educational purposes only.
