CF is caused by mutations in a single large gene on chromosome 7 that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, protein.</p><p>The phenotypic expression of disease varies according to the presence of specific mutation or mutations. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database, there are more than 1,300 different mutations in the CFTR gene with a potential to cause disease. The mutations of the CFTR gene have been divided into five different classes. However, the clinical implications of specific combinations of mutations are not always clear, possibly due to the influence of gene modifiers. Significant progress has been and continues to be made in the treatment of patients with CF using strategies to address both the underlying genetic defect and its downstream consequences. For example, two disease pathways that are potentially modifiable by pharmacotherapy include the \"potentiators,\" for gating type mutations which increase the time that the CFTR ion channel remains open, and \"correctors,\" which increase the quantity of CFTR that can be inserted into the apical membrane.</p>",
