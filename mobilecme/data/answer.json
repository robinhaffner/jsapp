Use of liposomes to transfer plasmids containing a functional CFTR cDNA to airway epithelium.</b></p><p>Current research efforts related to gene therapy are focused on finding ways for a safe delivery of a normal CFTR gene to the airways of patients with CF, as well as vector efficiency, transgene persistence, and overcoming host immune responses [Prickett M, Jain M. Transl Res. 2013;161:255-264; Griesenbach U, Alton EW. Curr Pharm Des. 2012;18:642-662]. The UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium is actively involved in clinical trials of gene therapy for patients with CF, using liposomes to transfer plasmids containing a functional CFTR cDNA. In a randomized phase 2 study, patients are administered CFTR-containing plasmid in liposomes or placebo every 4 weeks for 48 weeks [Alton EW et al. Thorax. 2013;68:1075-1077].</p><p>Other strategies are still in earlier stages of development. Preclinical work is underway to develop lentivirus-based vectors and adeno-associated virus- based vectors for CFTR gene transfer to airway epithelium [Griesenbach U et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2012;186:846-856; Keswani SG et al. PLoS One. 2012;7:e43633].</p>"
